For those of you who may be curious about the pin out of the (Sun) Cobalt RaQ and Qube LCD board pinouts, in this directory you will find pin maps of what I derived them to be.  

The RaQ pinout is pretty much determed mostly correct, as I am running my testing of the code in this repository on it.  The Qube layout has to be verified still.  

Unfortunately, the pinouts do not match up, so interchangably using the cables is not possible wihout an adapter board or modifcations to the interface board I am designing.  Both will probably make their way into this repository eventually though.
