Rpi-Cobalt

This project aims at creating software and a kernel module to interface a 
raspberry pi to the old cobalt chassis front panel.  Features include:

- working LCD support
- working button action support
- working kernel level front panel LEDs.

The hardware you will need includes:

- an old Cobalt RaQ case (Qube support is to follow)
- a raspberry pi
- a maple mini (or something with a good amount of GPIO pins)
- A logic leveler if you are running a 5V logic controller, the maple mini gets around this requirement


Experience to set up:

- experience running raspbian on a raspbery pi
- experience with arduino sketches.
- python and c experience is a plus
- simple hardware hacking skills ( wiring and such )

For the more advanced amoung you, if you want to make your own interface 
boards, you can probably do that too.  I plan on making one for the 
Cobalt Front Panel Cable, Maple Mini and RPi once I have all the software,
cabling, and kernel stuff sorted out.  A board layout may show up in this 
repository once it's ready.


If you are looking for LCD Board or Front Panel Board pinouts for the Cobalt Qube or Cobalt RaQ, check the docs/ directory.
